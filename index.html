        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The doctype declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. Doctype is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called Child Elements. The element that holds all the children is called the Parent Element.</li>
          <li>The words Element and Tag are used interchangeably in the development world but there is a difference. Element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag. Tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat yourself (DRY) is a coding principal that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>

          <li>The var keyword declares a variable. A Variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code. Use assignment operator = to assign specific data to be stored in a variable.</li>
